                <h3>- Ekaterina Woolsey</h3>
                <p>
                    Kat was born in 1999 and raised in southern California. She spent her younger years pursuing
                    artistic hobbies, but decided to change her focus and study geology as she set out to further her
                    education. She will be transferring to CSU Bakersfield in coming months to complete her bachelor’s
                    degree. Kat has a heart of gold, loves discovering new things about the world (especially if they
                    are rock-related), and is currently applying her artistic interests from her youth to develop skills
                    in graphic design. She loves ice cream, collecting crazy socks, and spending time with Mike more
                    than anything in the world.

                <h3>- Michael Peterson</h3>
                <p>
                    Mike was born during the spring of 1998 in Utah, but spent most of his youth in Iowa. There, during
                    his middle school and high school years, he further developed his skills as a maker, and began
                    pursuing his interests in computer science. He moved to California as a young adult, and currently
                    works for Wonderful Pistachios and Almonds as a web developer. Mike has a great sense of humor,
                    loves to go on adventures, and refuses to think inside the box. He has experience as an entrepreneur
                    that he plans to utilize in future business ventures, and he can tell you anything and everything
                    you need to know about laser cutting. He is kind-hearted and caring, and looks forward to many years
                    of adventuring with Kat.

                <h3>- Our Engagement</h3>
                <p>
                    Kat and Mike met at a social event for young adults in Bakersfield, shortly after Mike relocated to
                    California. They remained friends for almost three years before dating, and have been nearly
                    inseparable since. Mike proposed to Kat in January of 2021 at the Cal Poly Architecture Graveyard in
                    San Luis Obispo. The couple is currently working on starting a laser-cutting business together, and
                    they dream of tackling many more ambitions in the years to come. They happily anticipate the
                    adventures and challenges that await them.
